Using GitHubBox.com
An easy way to import a repo to CodeSandbox via URL is with GitHubBox.com. Append 'box' to your github.com URL in between 'hub' and '.com' and it will redirect to CodeSandbox.

Here's an example:

Change the GitHub URL: https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc.

To: https://githubbox.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc.

The result is we take the last part of the url (everything after github.com) and use it in our importer at codesandbox.io/s/github/, adding the repo to CodeSandbox.
